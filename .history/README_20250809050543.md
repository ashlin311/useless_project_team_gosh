## Project Description
A web app where legendary Mollywood actors roast your Spotify music taste (and optionally your singing) with hilarious, movie-reference-filled commentary.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody in history has ever woken up and thought, *"Man, I wish Mohanlal would roast my playlist while Fahadh Faasil listens in judgment."* But here we are.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We connect to your Spotify account, grab your top artists and tracks, and have Keralaâ€™s finest actors deliver world-class roasts â€” in Manglish, with movie references, and zero mercy. Oh, and you can record your singing for them to tear apart too.
