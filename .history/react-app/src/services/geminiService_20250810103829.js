Make it personal but hilarious with that signature Rangan laugh energy about their vocal performance.`,

Keep it sharp, authoritative, and concise‚Äîequal parts interrogation and scathing verdict about their vocal performance. Use natural Manglish phrases and maybe a subtle Commissioner reference. Deliver punchy sentences with that commanding authority about their singing technique.`,

Be ruthless and clever about their singing technique, maybe drop a subtle movie reference. Keep it charismatic but cutting about their musical abilities.`,
