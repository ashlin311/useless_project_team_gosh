Project Description
A web app where legendary Mollywood actors roast your Spotify music taste (and optionally your singing) with hilarious, movie-reference-filled commentary.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody in history has ever woken up and thought, "Man, I wish Mohanlal would roast my playlist while Fahadh Faasil listens in judgment." But here we are.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We connect to your Spotify account, grab your top artists and tracks, and have Keralaâ€™s finest actors deliver world-class roasts â€” in Manglish, with movie references, and zero mercy. Oh, and you can record your singing for them to tear apart too.
